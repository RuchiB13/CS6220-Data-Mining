**Project** : NBA “Moneyball”: An Analytical Approach to Cost-Effective Team Formation Using Hierarchical Clustering and Regression

Advanced statistics in sports drive the selection of the best players, which lead to an increased number of wins and improves fan support in addition to the overall economic growth for their respective cities. Achieving a well-rounded team is often easy for already successful and “rich” teams given their power and resources. However, a majority of teams are less successful in comparison to the top teams. This trait often means limited salary caps and a challenging journey out of the bottom and middle tier. By finding a way to generate these teams on budgets, we hypothesize that there would be increased competition and overall viewership of the sport. We devised a model that is capable of generating teams given a salary cap using linear regression and a method of capturing a set of player’s total win potential given their advanced statistics. To preface our initial goal, we also performed hierarchical clustering to determine if a player’s success and performance is attributed to his advanced statistics. Our metrics show that the teams formed are well within a budget and are viable teams based on historical performance.
